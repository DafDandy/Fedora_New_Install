# Swapping Desktops to KDE
If you want the traditional windows looking desktop like this:

![desktop](https://github.com/DafDandy/Fedora_New_Install/assets/102477185/ae600f5e-8b0d-43f4-a4ad-6857ca55b75f)


You just need to swap the desktop on the login screen

After you have done this once you shouldnt need to do this again, it will remember your settings and log you into this desktop
