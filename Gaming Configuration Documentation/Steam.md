# First time steam setup
You need to first enable proton to make sure that your game library is all compatible and using proton

Steam -> settings -> compatibility

Steam -> settings -> downloads

Next is to ensure that the shader compiling works as intended

Make sure that the pre-caching shaders is selected
This makes sure that before the game launches the shaders will compile so your game doesnt end up being a choppy mess

## Things to remember about gaming on linux
The first time you launch a game it will take longer to initially boot up, this is normal. Most of what is happening in the background is the game is 
configuring itself to run in the linux environment. This is during the first time run only, everytime afterwards as long as the game has not experienced a huge
update you should be up and running fairly quickly

If there are certain games that aren't showing up in your library or are acting up you can force them to use proton if they arent native
